// INTRO

All files found in the Lazy-dir are supposed to allow people to easily and 
quickly modify an existing card and/or create a new one.

The lazy-files are _low resolution_ and speedy creations. They are _not_
supposed to be used to create an end product: Their output will be inferior. 

Their only purpose is to serve as a temporary and fast dirty way to 
create new graphical representations of cards for unofficial oinline
playtestig.

For your convenience and to truly become even more lazy, all bitmap files
have been embedded.


// HOW TO USE  

a) lazy template constructor.xcf needs GIMP to open up. It's just used to
create differently textured versions of the Gaian Creature template.
Typically you'd have no reason to mess with this file.

b) lazy gaian creature.svg + inkscape 0.48 or above is all you need to
start creating Gaian creatures. Turn on / off layers, input the text
and a creature image, export the result and you're done.

c) Never upload your creations to the /trunk for playtesting unless you
ask/know what you are doing or have explicitly been delegated that task.
