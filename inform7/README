// What

Within this dir is our attempt to deliver an optional and richer 
background story for WTactics via enabeling the plateyer to partake in
a interactive fiction - a kind of novell where the player her/himself
has been put in the lead.

The goal is to use the IF to give the player a feeling of the atmosphere
where WTactics takes place. 

The setting for the story is some kind of happening in a castle where
there are relatively few rooms, some puzzles and many visitors that
together will represent the different factions and show signs of the 
conflicts found in the main background story of WTactics.org
