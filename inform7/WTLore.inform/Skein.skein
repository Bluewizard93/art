carriage
The black carriage in which you arrived in is parked at the side, in front of the entrance. The carriage is small, yet of finest comfort.

The black carriage in which you arrived in is parked at the side, in front of the entrance. The carriage is small, yet of finest comfort.

You notice a scroll container lying at the empty seat in front of you. It&apos;s of thick leather, looks unworn and hasn&apos;t been opened yet judging from the unbroken Imperial seal. 

The carriage is shaking back and forth as it finds it&apos;s way ahead.

The container is of good craftmanship, a cylindrical shape made of just a single piece of leather to better protect its content in case it would be exposed to water.

The first thing you want to do when starting a game is acquaint yourself with your surroundings and get a sense of your goal. To this end, you should read the introductory text carefully. Sometimes it contains clues. You will also want to look at the room you are in. Notice where the exits from the room are, and what objects are described here. If any of these seem interesting, you may want to EXAMINE them. 

You might also want to examine yourself (EXAMINE ME) to see whether the author has left you any clues about your character. TAKE INVENTORY will tell you what you&apos;re carrying, as well.

Once you&apos;ve gotten your bearings, you may want to explore. Move from room to room, and check out every location available.

The &gt; sign is where the game says, &quot;Okay, what do you want to do now?&quot;  You may respond by typing an instruction -- usually an imperative verb, possibly followed by prepositions and objects.  So, for instance, LOOK, LOOK AT FISH, TAKE FISH.

At any given time, you are in a specific location, or room. When you go into a room, the game will print a description of what you can see there. This description will contain two vital kinds of information: things in the room you can interact with or take, and a list of exits, or ways out. If you want to see the description again, you may just type LOOK. 

When you want to leave a location and go to another one, you may communicate this to the game using compass directions: eg, GO NORTH. For simplicity&apos;s sake, you are allowed to omit the word GO, and to abbreviate the compass directions. So you may use NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, NORTHEAST, SOUTHEAST, NORTHWEST, SOUTHWEST, UP, and DOWN, or in short form N, S, E, W, NE, SE, NW, SW, U, and D.

In some locations, IN and OUT will also be useful.

Throughout the game there will be assorted objects that you can do things with. Most importantly, you may TAKE or GET items, and (when you are tired of them) DROP them again. INVENTORY (abbreviated I) will list the items you are currently holding. 

There are usually assorted things you may do with these objects. OPEN, CLOSE, WEAR, EAT, LOCK, and UNLOCK are especially common.

Occasionally, you will find that the game does not recognize the name of an object even though it has been described as being in the room with you. If this is the case, the object is just there for scenery, and you may assume that you do not need to interact with it.

Examine every object and look at everything in your inventory. Open all the doors you can find, and go through them. Look inside all closed containers. Make sure you&apos;ve exhausted all the options in your environment. 

Try out all your senses. If the game mentions texture, odor, or sound, try touching, smelling, listening to, or tasting objects.

Be thorough. If you still can&apos;t figure out what to do, try opening windows, looking under beds, etc. Sometimes objects are well-hidden.

carriage
The black carriage in which you arrived in is parked at the side, in front of the entrance. The carriage is small, yet of finest comfort.

You notice a scroll container lying at the empty seat in front of you. It&apos;s of thick leather, looks unworn and hasn&apos;t been opened yet judging from the unbroken Imperial seal.

You find yourself standing in the castle entrance. It has a very high ceiling with what seems to be sections of thick heavy glass, revealing a clear night with stars incognito. There is a dim light at the east end of the passage.

There is a small wicker cage discarded nearby.

The black carriage in which you arrived in is parked at the side, in front of the entrance. The carriage is small, yet of finest comfort.

You notice a scroll container lying at the empty seat in front of you. It&apos;s of thick leather, looks unworn and hasn&apos;t been opened yet judging from the unbroken Imperial seal. 

The carriage wheels rumble over a small hole in the ground.
