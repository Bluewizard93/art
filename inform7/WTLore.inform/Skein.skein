carriage
When boarding the carriage you were impressed by the seemingly high standard in which you would get to travel: It&apos;s pitch black construction is heavily decorated with flower resembling golden patterns, it is spacious and of finest standard in every aspect. There are two comfortable wide seats that face each other in it, one of which you occupy. The carriage walls are covered with quilted dark red silk. The door is locked from the outside.

You notice a scroll container lying at the empty seat in front of you.It&apos;s of thick leather, looks newly made and hasn&apos;t been opened yet judging by the looks of the unbroken seal.

 The black glossy carriage is heavily decoareted with flower resembling golden patterns, it is spatious and of finest standard in every aspect.

When boarding the carriage eariler today you were impressed by the high standard in which you would get to travel: The black glossy carriage is heavily decoareted with flower resembling golden patterns, it is spatious and of finest standard in every aspect. There are two comfortable benches that face each other in it, one of which you occupy. The carriage walls are covered with quilted dark red silk, isolated with an unknown material. 

 You notice a scroll container lying at the empty seat in front of you.  It&apos;s of thick leather, looks unworn and hasn&apos;t been opened yet judging from the unbroken Imperial seal. 


You&apos;re bored by the long travels and have a tense feeling.

Rumor has it only the emperor, his nearest of kin and a few selected advisors are authorised to use it.  The container is of good craftmanship, a cylindrical shape made of just a single piece of leather to better protect its content in case it would be exposed to water.

When boarding the carriage eariler today you were impressed by the high standard in which you would get to travel: The black glossy carriage is heavily decoareted with flower resembling golden patterns, it is spatious and of finest standard in every aspect. There are two comfortable benches that face each other in it, one of which you occupy. The carriage walls are covered with quilted dark red silk, isolated with an unknown material. 

You notice a scroll container lying at the empty seat in front of you. It&apos;s of thick leather, looks unworn and the Imperial seal on it has been broken.

 It&apos;s pitch black construction is heavily decoareted with flower resembling golden patterns, it is spatious and of finest standard in every aspect. There are two comfortable wide seats that face each other in it, one of which you occupy. The carriage walls are covered with quilted dark red silk. The door is locked from the outside.

On the seat there are a couple of small thick red wax pieces that used to make up the seal of the scroll container. They&apos;re the remainder of the sigill, which is beyond recognition.

The scroll container is still here. It&apos;s of thick leather, looks newly made and is open. The Imperial seal on it is broken.

Ending the reading of the letter you realise the horses have halted. You have arrived.

It&apos;s time to perform the role of your life. You couldn&apos;t believe it when it happened: The huge honour, to be chosen for the task at hand. This would surely be the single most important assignment you could have dreamt of ever getting.


You memorise the content of the letter and make sure to carefully tear it into tiny random pieces beyond recognition. As you open the door you discard them in the evening breez while stepping down onto the sand.

The carriage starts moving again, this time with no passenger onboard other than the empty container left behind by you. You can&apos;t help wondering if this was your last ride given the dangers that lay ahead, if it is the final destination you would ever reach.

carriage
When boarding the carriage you were impressed by the seemingly high standard in which you would get to travel: It&apos;s pitch black construction is h avily decoareted with flower resembling golden patterns, it is spatious and of finest standard in every aspect. There are two comfortable wide seats that face each other in it, one of which you occupy. The carriage walls are covered with quilted dark red silk. The door is locked from the outside.

You notice a scroll container lying at the empty seat in front of you.It&apos;s of thick leather, looks newly made and hasn&apos;t been opened yet judging by the looks of the unbroken seal.

carriage
The black carriage in which you arrived in is parked at the side, in front of the entrance. The carriage is small, yet of finest comfort.

You notice a scroll container lying at the empty seat in front of you. It&apos;s of thick leather, looks unworn and hasn&apos;t been opened yet judging from the Imperial seal that is unbroken.

&gt;[2] open scroll container
You open the scroll container, revealing a scroll.

The first thing you want to do when starting a game is acquaint yourself with your surroundings and get a sense of your goal. To this end, you should read the introductory text carefully. Sometimes it contains clues. You will also want to look at the room you are in. Notice where the exits from the room are, and what objects are described here. If any of these seem interesting, you may want to EXAMINE them. 

You might also want to examine yourself (EXAMINE ME) to see whether the author has left you any clues about your character. TAKE INVENTORY will tell you what you&apos;re carrying, as well.

Once you&apos;ve gotten your bearings, you may want to explore. Move from room to room, and check out every location available.

The &gt; sign is where the game says, &quot;Okay, what do you want to do now?&quot;  You may respond by typing an instruction -- usually an imperative verb, possibly followed by prepositions and objects.  So, for instance, LOOK, LOOK AT FISH, TAKE FISH.

At any given time, you are in a specific location, or room. When you go into a room, the game will print a description of what you can see there. This description will contain two vital kinds of information: things in the room you can interact with or take, and a list of exits, or ways out. If you want to see the description again, you may just type LOOK. 

When you want to leave a location and go to another one, you may communicate this to the game using compass directions: eg, GO NORTH. For simplicity&apos;s sake, you are allowed to omit the word GO, and to abbreviate the compass directions. So you may use NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, NORTHEAST, SOUTHEAST, NORTHWEST, SOUTHWEST, UP, and DOWN, or in short form N, S, E, W, NE, SE, NW, SW, U, and D.

In some locations, IN and OUT will also be useful.

Throughout the game there will be assorted objects that you can do things with. Most importantly, you may TAKE or GET items, and (when you are tired of them) DROP them again. INVENTORY (abbreviated I) will list the items you are currently holding. 

There are usually assorted things you may do with these objects. OPEN, CLOSE, WEAR, EAT, LOCK, and UNLOCK are especially common.

Occasionally, you will find that the game does not recognize the name of an object even though it has been described as being in the room with you. If this is the case, the object is just there for scenery, and you may assume that you do not need to interact with it.

Examine every object and look at everything in your inventory. Open all the doors you can find, and go through them. Look inside all closed containers. Make sure you&apos;ve exhausted all the options in your environment. 

Try out all your senses. If the game mentions texture, odor, or sound, try touching, smelling, listening to, or tasting objects.

Be thorough. If you still can&apos;t figure out what to do, try opening windows, looking under beds, etc. Sometimes objects are well-hidden.

carriage
The black carriage in which you arrived in is parked at the side, in front of the entrance. The carriage is small, yet of finest comfort.

You notice a scroll container lying at the empty seat in front of you. It&apos;s of thick leather, looks unworn and hasn&apos;t been opened yet judging from the unbroken Imperial seal.

carriage
 The night black carriage is heavily decoareted with flower resembling golden patterns, it is spatious and of finest standard in every aspect. There are two comfortable benches that face each other in it, one of which you occupy. The carriage walls are covered with quilted dark red silk, isolated with an unknown material. 

You notice a scroll container lying at the empty seat in front of you.  It&apos;s of thick leather, looks newly made and hasn&apos;t been opened yet judging by the looks of the unbroken Imperial seal.

This modest piece of interactive fiction is played out in the setting of WTactics.org and has been written to give you a richer understanding and experience of the universe in which WT is set. The game can stand on its own without any prior knowledge about WTactics.org or CCG:s.

carriage
When boarding the carriage you were impressed by the seemingly high standard in which you would get to travel: It&apos;s pitch black construction is heavily decoareted with flower resembling golden patterns, it is spatious and of finest standard in every aspect. There are two comfortable wide seats that face each other in it, one of which you occupy. The carriage walls are covered with quilted dark red silk. The door is locked from the outside.

Rumor has it only the emperor, his nearest of kin and a few selected advisors are authorised to use it. The container is of good craftmanship. It has a cylindrical shape made of just a single piece of leather to better protect its content in case it would be exposed to water.

Castle Hallway room
You find yourself standing in the castle entrance. It has a very high ceiling with what seems to be sections of thick heavy glass, revealing a clear night with stars incognito. There is a dim light at the east end of the passage.

There is a small wicker cage discarded nearby.

carriage
When boarding the carriage eariler today you were impressed by the high standard in which you would get to travel: The black glossy carriage is heavily decoareted with flower resembling golden patterns, it is spatious and of finest standard in every aspect. There are two comfortable benches that face each other in it, one of which you occupy. The carriage walls are covered with quilted dark red silk, isolated with an unknown material. 

 You notice a scroll container lying at the empty seat in front of you.  It&apos;s of thick leather, looks unworn and hasn&apos;t been opened yet judging from the unbroken Imperial seal.

When boarding the carriage eariler today you were impressed by the high standard in which you would get to travel: The black glossy carriage is heavily decoareted with flower resembling golden patterns, it is spatious and of finest standard in every aspect. There are two comfortable benches that face each other in it, one of which you occupy. The carriage walls are covered with quilted dark red silk, isolated with an unknown material. 

 You notice a scroll container lying at the empty seat in front of you.  It&apos;s of thick leather, looks unworn and hasn&apos;t been opened yet judging from the unbroken Imperial seal.

The carriage is finally slowing down, and halts suddenly. You have arrived.

It&apos;s time to perform the role of your life. You couldn&apos;t believe it when it happened: The huge honour, to be chosen for the task at hand. This would surely be the single most important assignment you could have dreamt of ever getting.
You memorise the content of the letter and make sure to carefully tear it into tiny random pieces beyond recognition. As you open the door you discard them in the evening breez while stepping down onto the sand. The carriage takes its leave.

You find yourself standing in the castle entrance. It has a very high ceiling with what seems to be sections of thick heavy glass, revealing a clear night with stars incognito. There is a dim light at the east end of the passage.

You notice a scroll container lying at the empty seat in front of you.  It&apos;s of thick leather, looks newly made and hasn&apos;t been opened yet judging by the looks of the unbroken Imperial seal.

You are carrying nothing.

Will this journey never end? Time goes slowly by.

&gt;[3] open scroll container
The carriage is finally beginning to slow down as you reach for the scroll container. The broken wax falls of in small pieces on the seat. Seeing this, you hesitate a moment, as if the container wasn&apos;t meant for you eben though you know it is. It was placed there by trusted messenger, the word directly sent from the court of his Imperial highness. 

You think about it for a second and realise you stopped for a moment not because you would violate the law of secrecy by resting eyes where they didn&apos;t belong, but because you know how important the content of the container is.

Your orders are in the container, waiting to be read.

It serves no purpose to close it now that the sigill on it has been broken into several pieces.

Your mission is... Letter text here...

Ending the reading of the letter you realise the horses have halted. You have arrived.

It&apos;s time to perform the role of your life. You couldn&apos;t believe it when it happened: The huge honour, to be chosen for the task at hand. This would surely be the single most important assignment you could have dreamt of ever getting.


You memorise the content of the letter and make sure to carefully tear it into tiny random pieces beyond recognition. As you open the door you discard them in the evening breez while stepping down onto the sand.

The carriage starts moving again, this time with no passenger onboard other than the empty container left behind by you. You can&apos;t help wondering if this was your last ride given the dangers that lay ahead, if it was the final destination you would ever reach.

 The black glossy carriage is heavily decoareted with flower resembling golden patterns, it is spatious and of finest standard in every aspect.

 You notice a scroll container lying at the empty seat in front of you.  It&apos;s of thick leather, looks unworn and hasn&apos;t been opened yet judging from the unbroken Imperial seal.

The carriage is finally slowing down, and halts suddenly. You have arrived.

It&apos;s time to perform the role of your life. You couldn&apos;t believe it when it happened: The huge honour, to be chosen for the task at hand. This would surely be the single most important assignment you could have dreamt of ever getting.
You memorise the content of the letter and make sure to carefully tear it into tiny random pieces. As  discarding them in the evening breez as you open the door of the carriage and step down onto sand. The carriage takes its leave.

Yard
You have never witnessed such a marvelous garden before.

Seeing this, you hesitate a moment, as if the container wasn&apos;t meant for you even though you know it is. It was placed there by trusted messenger, the word directly sent from the court of his Imperial highness. 

You think about it for a second and realise you stopped for a moment not because you would violate the law of secrecy by resting eyes where they didn&apos;t belong, but because you know how important the content of the container is.

Your orders are in the container, waiting to be read.

It&apos;s pitch black construction is heavily decoareted with flower resembling golden patterns, it is spatious and of finest standard in every aspect. There are two comfortable wide seats that face each other in it, one of which you occupy. The carriage walls are covered with quilted dark red silk. The door is locked from the outside.

On the seat there&apos;s a red piece of wax. It used to guarantee the authenticity of the msg, but is just smudgy filth now.

The scroll container is still here. It&apos;s of thick leather, looks newly made and is open. The Imperial seal on it is broken.

Your orders are in the container, waiting to be read.

In the scroll container is a letter.
