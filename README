// WTactics.org Developers Package

v.2.0 released 25:th July 2010


// INTRO

Welcome and thank you for downloading the WTactics Dev. Package. It contains all our resources at WTactics.org 
and empowers you and the community by giving you _everything_ you need to start contributing by creating new cards,
translations or new web content for our sites. 

WTactics is an trul free and open source CCG. It gives you great freedom, and with freedom comes responsibility:
Please refer to the README files in every dir for proper information about license(s), credits and other info.

We would love it if you wanted to help us out in _any way_ possible and would appreciate it if you contacted us
before doing so, allowing us all to make the best of our knowledge, skills and to co-ordinate the WTactics-project 
in general. 

Also feel free to send us any questions or thoughts - we like mail and read and answer it all when we get
a chance: contact@WTactics.org


// HOW TO USE

I. Some of our files link to other files in the package. Because of that you must make sure that the directory structure 
of the dev. package is intact and looks exactly as it did when you downloaded it. We use relative paths and suggest you 
do the same in order to make it easy for others to use your work. In other words: Don't move, delete or rename any 
already existing files or dirs, and all should go well. 

II. You need Inkscape (inkscape.org) to properly work with our SVG-files. Inkscape is a great open source vector program
and is available for all major platforms such as Linux, Windows and Mac.

III. After installing Inkscape you may need to install the fonts we use on your system. When that is done you can start
up Inkscape and open the SVG-files. If you did everything correct in the above steps it should all work out now.


// PLEASE 

For the sake of clarity and simplicity we beg you to only share & spread this package using it's offiical name if it
is in it's orginal form with all of it's content intact and in it's original state. It will make life easier for all of
us and will help to keep the integrity of the project if there are only official versions around of the "WTactics Dev. Package".
If you want to assemble a custom dev. package or other packages you are free to do so, but please use a very different name on
it. Please note that you are always legally allowed to, among other things, share our work(s) found within the package
in accordabce to the works associated license(s).


// KEEP IN MIND

However you modify, contribute to or use the material in this package it would in most cases automatically become legally released
under one or several of the open source-licenses we use. Please read the licenses or contact us for answeres to your questions or
other information about these matters.
